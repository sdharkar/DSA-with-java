## Introduction

This repository serves as a practical guide to data structures and algorithms. It includes well-documented Java implementations that you can study, modify, and use in your projects. The focus is on clarity and efficiency, aiming to make these fundamental concepts more accessible to learners.

## Data Structures

This repository covers the following data structures:

*   **Arrays:** Basic array operations, including searching, sorting, etc.
*   **Linked Lists:** Singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, circular linked lists, and associated operations.
*   **Stacks:** Implementations using arrays and linked lists, with push, pop, and peek operations.
*   **Queues:** Implementations using arrays and linked lists, with enqueue, dequeue, and peek operations.
*   **Trees:** Binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and associated traversals (in-order, pre-order, post-order), and search algorithms.
*   **Heaps:** Min-heaps and max-heaps, and operations for priority queue functionality.
*   **Graphs:** Adjacency list and adjacency matrix representations, with common graph algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Dijkstra's Algorithm, etc.
*   **Hash Tables:** Implementation with different collision resolution techniques.

## Algorithms

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/): Ensure you have JDK 8 or higher installed on your system.
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads): Required for cloning the repository.
*   An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/), or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (optional, but recommended).

### Cloning the Repository

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
3.  Use the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME.git
    ```

    Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` and `YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

### Compiling and Running

1.  Navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository:

    ```bash
    cd YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME
    ```
2.  Compile the Java files using the following command (assuming you're in the project root):

    ```bash
    javac src/**/*.java
    ```
3.  Run a specific class example (replace `your.example.ClassName` with the specific example):

    ```bash
    java your.example.ClassName
    ```
    *Note*: You might need to adjust classpaths depending on the IDE or environment you use.

## Usage

*   Explore the source code in the `src` directory to see the implementations.
*   Look for the `main` methods in the examples to understand how to use the data structures and algorithms.
*   Experiment by modifying the code or by implementing variations of the current methods.
*   Feel free to use these implementations in your own projects but give appropriate credit.

## Contributing
