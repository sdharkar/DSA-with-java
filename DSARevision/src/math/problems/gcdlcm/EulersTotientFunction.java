// Problem: Count numbers less than  n  that are relatively prime to  n  (Eulerâ€™s Totient Function).

import java.util.Scanner;

// Logic: 
// Base Case: If n is less than or equal to 1, return false.	
// Recursive Case: If n is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of n, return false.
// Otherwise, return true.

// Algorithm:
// 1. Define a function isPrime(n).
// 2. If n is less than or equal to 1, return false.
// 3. Otherwise, check if n is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of n.
// 4. If it is divisible, return false.
// 5. Otherwise, return true.
